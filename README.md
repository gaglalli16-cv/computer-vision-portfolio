# Computer Vision Portfolio — Gagandeep Kaur

I am a Master’s student in Computer Vision with a background in Computer Science and experience around industrial automation systems. This repository contains selected computer vision projects.

## Projects

1. **Wildlife Species Image Classification**  
   *PyTorch · ResNet50 · Transfer Learning · Data Augmentation*  
   Deep learning–based wildlife species classification using camera trap images, with performance evaluation and augmentation strategies.  
   → `wildlife-image-classification/`

2. **Tear Film Break-Up Detection (FIPA Project)**  
   *Classical Image Processing · ROI Extraction · Thresholding · Temporal Analysis*  
   Semi-automatic pipeline for tear film break-up detection in fluorescein eye image sequences, developed for an academic image processing course.  
   → `FIPA-roi-extraction/`

3. Texture-Based Image Classification using Homogeneous Local Binary Patterns (HLBP)
   (Classical Image Processing / Feature Engineering / k-NN, SVM)
