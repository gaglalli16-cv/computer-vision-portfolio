## Projects

### 1. Wildlife Species Image Classification  
**PyTorch · ResNet50 · Transfer Learning · Data Augmentation**

Deep learning–based wildlife species classification using camera trap images. The project explores transfer learning, data augmentation strategies, and performance evaluation on real-world ecological data.

### 2. Tear Film Break-Up Detection (FIPA Project)  
**Classical Image Processing · ROI Extraction · Thresholding · Temporal Analysis**

A semi-automatic classical image processing pipeline for tear film break-up detection in fluorescein eye image sequences. Developed as part of the *Fundamentals of Image Processing and Analysis (FIPA)* course, with a strong focus on interpretability and deterministic processing.

### 3. Image Description & Modeling — Texture Analysis (HLBP)  
**Handcrafted Texture Features · Classical Classification**

*Context:* Academic project (Image Description and Modeling)  
*Type:* Individual project

This project focuses on **texture-based image description** using **Histogram Local Binary Patterns (HLBP)** for medical image tiles.

Key highlights:
- Manual feature extraction (no deep learning)
- Texture descriptors (LBP / HLBP)
- Statistical analysis of texture distributions
- Classical classifier evaluation
- Strong emphasis on interpretability and feature design
